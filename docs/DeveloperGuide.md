## Setting up

## Design 
### Architecture
![Architecture_Diagram](./uml/DinerDirectorArchitectureDiagram.png)
The **Architecture Diagram** given above explains the high-level design of DinerDirector. 
Given below is a quick overview of main components and how they interact with each other. 

**Main components of architecture** <br/>
`DinerDirector` entry point to the application is DinerDirector. Initially, `DinerDirector` class interact with `UI` class to 
prompt user for inputs. Once user keys in the input text, the input will be redirected to `Parser` class. `Parser` class will manage the error 
handling of user's input. Next, any logic will be executed by `Command` object. If there exists any interaction with `Entity`, `Command` will 
request to `Manager` to assist the CRUD operations.  


### Command Component (Zheng Rong)
### Manager Component (PeiHao)
### Ui Component (HuiQi)
The Ui Component consists of the TextUi class that handles interactions between the app and the user.

This includes the following methods:
1. Reading the user input (Empty inputs will be ignored)

    method: getUserInput())
2. Printing messages generated by the app to the terminal

    method: printBanner(), printMessage()

### Utils Component (Darren)
(Insert Class Diagram)  
The Utils Component consists of the Parser class that will handle the parsing and preparing of commands within the DinerDirector application.  
The `Parser` class performs the following functions: 
* Parse the command given the user input and extracts out the necessary information related to the command.
* Returns the appropriate Command Class based on the parsed input.

## Implementation
### Parsing Feature (Darren)
(Insert Sequence Diagram)  
How the parsing works:
1. When the `parseCommand()` method is called from `DinerDirector` class, the `parseCommand()` will split the given userInput first.
2. With the `userInputSplit[]`, the `0` index will be extracted out. That will be used as identification for the command the user typed in.
3. The `commandWord` will be used in the switch statement to select the appropriate command. returning `IncorrectCommand` class is the default behavior.
4. If the `commandWord` is valid, it will run the appropriate `prepareXYZCommand()`.
5. Each of the individual `prepareXYZCommand()` will take in the userInput without the command portion. The variable is named `userInputNoCommand`. The `prepareXYZCommand()` will check the userInput to see if all the appropriate values are added, and return `XYZCommand` class if the values are correct. `prepareXXXCommand()` will return `IncorrectCommand` class if there are some missing values or inappropriate values.
### Meeting Feature (PeiHao)
### Deadline Feature (HuiQi)
The Deadline Feature allows user to add Deadline objects in a deadline list.
Deadline objects consists of a description String and a dueDate String.
The User will also be able to delete deadlines, view deadline list.

When the user input a deadline command, it will be parsed into Parser to determine which deadline command will be called.
Then, the deadline command will be executed, and the respective method in the DeadlineManager class will be called, which are:
1. addDeadline 

    Adds the deadline object to the ArrayList `deadlines`.
    
    A deadline object can only be added to the deadlines list if it has a valid description and dueDate String.
    
    If the addition was a success, a message will be printed through TextUi class to notify the reader that the deadline object has been added.


2. deleteDeadline

    Removes a deadline object from the ArrayList `deadlines` using the index given.
    A deadline object can only be removed if the index is a valid index in the list.
    If the deletion was a success, a message will be printed through TextUi class to notify the reader that the deadline object has been deleted.

3. printDeadlines

    Prints the ArrayList `deadlines` through TextUi class.
### Staff Feature 
The `Staff` Feature allows user to create, read, update, delete (CRUD) `Staff` objects in the list of staffs. 
`Staff` list is managed by `StaffManager` Class similar to other entity objects. Here are hot it works for each functionality: 

1. add_staff <br>
It first checks whether the parameter needed to add `Staff` is already given in the correct format. If it passes the format checking, 
the `Parser` object will return `AddStaffCommand` to be executed by `DinerDirector`. Internally, `AddStaffCommand` redirect the requests to 
`StaffManager` to add the `Staff` object to the list of `Staff` 
2. delete_staff  
It firsts find the corresponding `Staff` object to be deleted using its name in the list in `StaffManager`. 
If it is found, it will delete the correct corresponding `Staff`. 

3. view_staff  
It prints all of `Staff` objects in `StaffManager`'s staffs.
